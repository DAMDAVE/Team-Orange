1.	Project Overview:

1.1 Introduction:
Team Orange is developing a mental health app aimed at providing support and resources to individuals experiencing mental health challenges. The app will include validated mental health assessments and measurement scales to help users determine their stress levels, anxiety, and depression. The app will also feature educational content, resources, and personalized recommendations for seeking appropriate help.

1.2 Project Objectives:
 The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly app or website that focuses on mental health. The application will allow users to take assessment questionnaires to determine their levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The personalized results will provide insights and recommendations for managing mental well-being. Additionally, the app will offer a resource library, goal setting, journaling, community support, and ensure data privacy and security.

1.3 Target Audience:
The target audience for the mental health app/website includes individuals seeking to assess and improve their mental well-being. This may include individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, or those interested in maintaining their mental health.

1.4 Key Features:
The key features of the mental health app/website will include user registration and profiles, assessment questionnaires, personalized results and insights, a resource library, goal setting and tracking, community support, data privacy and security measures, journaling as well as collaboration and future expansion possibilities.

2. Research insights:
  2.1 Introduction:
          Mental health is an essential component of overall well-being that is often overlooked. This research aims to provide a simplified and easy-to-understand overview of the current state of mental health in Africa, with a specific focus on Nigeria. By exploring the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, this research will help the team gain valuable insights and understanding to effectively address mental health challenges in Nigeria.
Nigeria is facing a severe mental health crisis with a population of over 200 million people more than 60 million people are dealing with mental illness with little to no help.
 In Nigeria, fewer than 10 percent of those battling mental illness have access to mental healthcare. Access is mainly limited to cities, leaving the rural areas without resources for psychiatric care. Since half of the population of Nigeria live in rural areas, those people do not have access to mental healthcare. Those people are turning to self-medication, self-diagnosis and misunderstanding or denial of their symptoms. Many of those without help are children and adolescents.
On the 5th of January 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari signed a new Mental Health bill into Law, repealing heretofore extant law, which was known as the Lunacy Act CAP 524, of the Laws Of Nigeria 1964.
Also, at the World Mental Health Day (WMHD), psychiatrists raised the alarm that one in four Nigerians (over 50 million Nigerians) are suffering from one mental disorder or the other.
They added that about 75 % of those who need mental health care do not have access to it, as Nigeria has only 300 psychiatrists to treat at least 200 million people.
Depression is the most common illness that affects mental health. In a global survey, Nigeria ranked 15 in the number of suicides per year. In another survey, Nigeria was ranked the most depressed country in Africa. Despite the government’s inability to manage mental health in Nigeria, there is hope.

2.1 Prevalence of Mental Health Conditions in Nigeria

 Stress:
   Stress is a common mental health concern affecting individuals worldwide. In Nigeria, factors such as economic pressures, and social inequalities contribute to high levels of stress. Studies indicate that stress is prevalent across different population groups, including students, working professionals, and individuals from low-income communities.

 Anxiety:
   Anxiety disorders  are characterized by excessive worrying, fear, and restlessness. In Nigeria, anxiety is a significant mental health issue, affecting individuals of all ages. Factors such as insecurity, political instability, and economic challenges contribute to heightened anxiety levels. Research suggests that anxiety is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in Nigeria, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and support.

Depression:
   Depression is a common mental health condition globally, and Nigeria is no exception. Studies estimate that the prevalence of depression in Nigeria is high, with a significant burden on individuals, families, and communities. Socioeconomic factors, limited access to mental health services, and stigma associated with mental illness contribute to the challenges faced in diagnosing and managing depression in Nigeria.

 Eating disorders:
   Although research on eating disorders in Nigeria is limited, cultural influences and societal pressures surrounding body image play a role in the development of disordered eating patterns. The desire for a specific body shape, especially among young adults and adolescents, can lead to behaviors such as restrictive eating, binge eating, and purging. Greater awareness and research are needed to fully understand the prevalence and impact of eating disorders in Nigeria.

Cultural and Societal Factors:
- Stigma and Discrimination: Stigma associated with mental health issues in Nigeria hinders help-seeking and care. Education and awareness campaigns are needed to reduce stigma.
- Traditional Beliefs and Practices: Traditional beliefs influence help-seeking behaviors. Collaborations between traditional healers and modern healthcare providers can improve mental health support.
- Socioeconomic Factors: Poverty, unemployment, and inequality impact mental health. Addressing socioeconomic disparities is crucial for better mental health outcomes.

Healthcare System and Mental Health Services:
- Availability and Accessibility of Services: Nigeria faces challenges in providing sufficient mental health services. Investments in infrastructure and community-based care are needed for better accessibility.
- Mental Health Policy and Legislation: Nigeria has policies and legislation for mental health but their effective implementation needs improvement.
- Workforce and Training: Nigeria has a shortage of mental health professionals. Enhancing training programs and retention strategies can improve workforce capacity.

Impacts of Mental Health Issues:
- Individual Impact: Mental health conditions affect quality of life, relationships, and productivity. Early intervention is crucial.
- Social and Economic Impact: Mental health issues have broader societal and economic implications. Investing in mental health support yields long-term benefits.

Strategies for Improving Mental Health Support:
- Awareness and Education: Educating the public about mental health and available resources reduces stigma and promotes help-seeking.
- Reducing Stigma: Engaging media, religious leaders, and community influencers challenges misconceptions and promotes acceptance.
- Integration of Mental Health Services: Integrating mental health into primary healthcare improves access and early intervention.
- Training and Capacity Building: Investing in training and professional development enhances service delivery.
- Collaboration and Partnerships: Collaboration among stakeholders mobilizes resources and develops sustainable mental health programs.
In conclusion:
Insights on Mental Health in Nigeria and Africa:
•	Mental health disorders are prevalent in Nigeria, with conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse being common.
