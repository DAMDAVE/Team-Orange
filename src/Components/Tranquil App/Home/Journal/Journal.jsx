//run npm start in your terminal after navigating to the directory of this project in your local machine just like we did the other day;
//it'll display the normal flow of the app but you'll have to edit the url in the search bar to localhost:3000/Team-Orange/#/journal
//that's where i put this page's route
//if you want to view it on your phone as you're editing , make sure your computer is connected to your phone's network while you run npm start, it gives a second url that's not localhost
//navigate to that too and change the url too. If this isn't clear, feel free to contact me

//you might want to log into the app maybe just to see what it looks like firsthand, use the manual signup option , google doesn't work for now and even if it did, on localhost, it wouldn't
//if you're done with a page and want to start another, commit your changes, i'll edit it for a new route and you can continue
